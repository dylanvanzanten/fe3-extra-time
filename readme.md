## ***Short description***
This is a assignment about the extra time that's being put into the subject [Frontend 3](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18). Here you can read all the stuff that I've put extra time in.

1. Read some info about the append function in D3 because I didn't know what it did in the code in the examples, so I checked how the `.append` function worked and how to understand it.
